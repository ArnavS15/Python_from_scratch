# Python_from_scratch
learning how to code for the very first time felt tough to me till i started to actually sit for long with a dedicated course and tutorials so now its all hands on and this is where i put my daily codes no matter how insignificant they seem right now but this will include projects in the future!
im following code with harry"s one shot video of python and practicing codes myself on vscode with its extensions applied and practicing problems there as well topicwise
for now i have completed till conditional statements if else so i will daily upload the codes in folders
